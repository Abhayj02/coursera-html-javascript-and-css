            <p>Dogs are part of the family in 46.3 million households in the United States, more than any other pet, according to the American Pet Products Association. The average dog owner has 1.7 dogs, meaning that there are about 78 million pet dogs. Dogs have been domesticated for about 14,000 years, longer than any other animal. People love dogs because they generally are easy to train, faithful and loyal, and can go almost anywhere. They will also protect your home and act as a playmate for the entire family.</p>

              Cats
            </div>
            <p>Approximately 38.9 million American households own cats, notes the American Pet Products Association. However, there are more pet cats than dogs, at 86.4 million, because cat owners tend to have more cats per household – around 2.2. Cats can exercise themselves and don’t need to be walked or taken outside to relieve themselves. They keep themselves groomed and even when they’re full, will gladly perform rodent-control duties.</p>

            <p>While statistics are not as clear cut for rabbits, the American Veterinary Medical Association reports that 6.2 million rabbits reside in 19 million homes. Cute and cuddly rabbits need proper attention and should never be an impulse buy. Rabbits are quiet so make great apartment pets, but they also need exercise. Once they realize they are not your prey, they can make affectionate and entertaining pets.</p>
